note : don't forget to add aws secret key to providers.tf

first let's set up the Route 53 hosted zone
1- to deploy the hosted zone 
	- cd DNS Zone
	- terraform init
	- terraform plan	
	- terraform apply
- once the apply completes you'll have 2 outputs : 
nameservers : to declare in namecheap
zone_id : dns hosted zone id for the next step.

once complete 
	- copy nameservers and past them into namecheap 
	- don't forget to add the "." at the end of the nameserver

- step 2 : 
	- create the lambda function with dns record
	- type cd ..
	- then get the zone id output from the first step and past it in var.tf zone_id variable
	- after you copy the id then you can : 
		- terraform init
		- terraform plan 
		- terraform apply
	- once this apply is complete you'll get the domain name of your lambda as an output

let's check
it works ~~
